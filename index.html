            <h2>About<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">(Wiki)</a></h2>
            <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.[2] Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</p>

            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.[3][4][5][6] Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.[6] In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.[4] Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[7][8] There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.[8] It currently offers 20 agents to choose from.[2][9] They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, Fade and Harbor. The player will get 5 unlocked agents (Brimstone, Sova, Sage, Phoenix and Jett) and will have to unlock the agents by activating that agent's contract.</p>

            <h3>Agents</h3>
            <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, the studio behind League of Legends.[29][6] Development started in 2014, within their research and development division.[3] Joe Ziegler, Valorant's game director, is credited with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.[3] David Nottingham is the creative director for Valorant.[3] Trevor Romleski, former League of Legends's designer and Salvatore Garozzo, former professional player and map designer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are game designers for Valorant.[30] Moby Francke, former Valve developer, who has been art and character designer for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, is the art director.[31][32]

                Valorant was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players, and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, while solving many of the points of criticism voiced by professional players from games in the genre.[33][34][35] Games aimed at large, active communities and player bases, typically free-to-play games like Fortnite or Riot's own League of Legends, tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and game stability rather than newer technologies or graphics as a way of making sure they're as accessible as possible. In interviews leading up to the game's launch, game director Joe Ziegler and producer Anna Donlon said that Valorant was made for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was for professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a large priority.[34]

            <h4> 
                Created in February 2019 by mobile games influencer PlayHard, LOUD started with a Free Fire team, and in 2020 the organization expanded into Fortnite. In October 2020, Riot Brazil announced LOUD as one of the teams selected to participate in CBLOL from the 2021 season onwards.

                Sometimes called the "Brazilian FaZe Clan" due to their heavy focus on content creation, the team has gotten one of the largest fanbases in Brazilian esports. This has created what can be called the "LOUD Effect": when a player or personality joins the organization, the person's social media follower numbers skyrocket in a very short time.
